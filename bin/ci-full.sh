# bin/ci-full.sh: run EVERY tier this repo's GitHub CI runs, in one process.
#
# .github/workflows/ci.yml fans this repo out as three jobs (ci, drift-guards,
# coverage). The pre-push venue gate used to run only `npm run ci`, so a push
# could gate green locally and then go red on GitHub on a job the gate never
# ran (2026-08-15: exactly that, on three repos at once). This script IS the
# local twin of the workflow: every job's run-steps, transcribed, in job
# order. When ci.yml gains or changes a job, change this script in the same
# commit.
#
# Layout: siblings resolve at ../<repo>, which is both the platform monorepo
# layout and the venue gate's work/ layout (.ci-siblings ships them there). A
# sibling a GitHub job checks out is REQUIRED here: missing means fail loud,
# never skip, because GitHub will run the step this gate would be skipping.
#
# All tiers run even after one fails (GitHub reports every red job, so this
# reports every red tier); the exit code is red if any tier was.
